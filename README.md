# ThisAbility

ThisAbility is a workout generator app that also caters to the specific needs of individuals with disabilities. It offers a customizable week-long program that is based on user input such as equipment available, workout type, and frequency. One of main unique features of ThisAbility is its inclusivity, which aims to meet the needs of individuals with conditions like Cerebral Palsy, Scoliosis, Parkinson’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. The data representing resistance exercises is arranged to ensure that exercises can be marked as safe or unsafe for an individual of a specific condition. For example, an exercise like deadlifts is not recommended for people with Scoliosis; accordingly, the algorithm will never include deadlifts in a person with Scoliosis’ workout plan, even if they have the correct equipment and workout types selected. This feature ensures that the app is both safe and effective for individuals with disabilities.

Additionally, the app includes informational popups that educate users about the importance of aerobic and resistance exercise and how it affects their health, as well as the unique needs of individuals with different disabilities. This not only empowers those with disabilities, but also those who may be able to give advice to someone with one of these disabilities.

As a personal quirk, the backgrounds of this app were generated using p5.js code that I wrote after I felt inspired by a piece of generative art I saw. All I needed to do was change the color code configuration in my code for a beautiful background that matched my selected color scheme.

Lastly, the app is state-saving between navigations in either direction, and has the capacity to load any csv file containing resistance exercises that conforms to the template. Meaning that anyone can customize the exercises they would like to be used in the generator.

Overall, ThisAbility offers a comprehensive and inclusive workout generation experience that is tailored to the unique needs of individuals with and without disabilities. It is a tool that comes with practical, educational, and visual features.
